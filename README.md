# Ideas That Aren't Lost

Being creative folks, ideas about our work/culture/projects/etc come and go at
all hours of the day. Instead of throwing them away or tossing them into the
fury that is Slack, let's document them here. This creates a searchable and
taggable place to share as a company and pass on to people who join our fray.

## How It Works

Create an issue on this repository. Mention folks who are pertinent to the idea
in the issue or hit them up on Slack/email/smoke signals, whatever.
Pretty simple: build consensus and integrate feedback. Have a
conversation then when ready, if action is required open an RFC (request for
comments) in the RFC folder of this repo and create a pull request.

## Why An RFC

We work in software and in software these days, RFC's are the most effective
way to make a difference or simply change something. [Rust][1] being the most
prominent RFC adopter of late. The linked repo has some great info on the
entire RFC process if anyone wants to delve deeper into the process (or perhaps
suggest another).
